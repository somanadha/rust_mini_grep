Rust tells us that our code 
ignored the Result value 
and the Result value might 
indicate that an error occurred. 
But we’re not checking to 
see whether or not 
there was an error, and error
the compiler reminds us that we 
probably meant to have 
some error-handling code here! 
Let’s rectify that  problem now.
